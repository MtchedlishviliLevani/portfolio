                I'm Levan, a 23-year-old self-taught front-end developer. Currently, I'm
                mastering <b>React.js</b> to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I
                also have experience with <b>Next.js</b>  for server-side rendering and I have started learning backend development with <b>Express.js</b>  a few months ago. While my primary
                focus remains on front-end development, I'm eager to further explore
                backend development and eventually become a full-stack developer. The
                challenges of front-end development are both motivating and rewarding
                for me.
